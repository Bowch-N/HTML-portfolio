<h2> 89 - Eighty Six </h2>
<p> 
    The Republic of San Magnolia has been at war with the Giadian Empire for nine years. 
    Though it initially suffered devastating losses to the Empire's autonomous mechanized Legions, 
    The Republic has since developed its own autonomous units—Juggernauts—which are directed remotely by a Handler. 
    While on the surface the public believes the war is being fought between machines, in reality, 
    the Juggernauts are being piloted by humans and all of them are the Eighty-Six, 
    the designation given to the sub-humans of the Eighty-Sixth Sector who are persecuted and 
    stripped of their rights by the racist-led Alba government.
    <br /><br />
    
    Major Vladilena "Lena" Milizé is an Alba noble and military officer in the Republic's Military 
    who is assigned as a Handler of the Spearhead Squadron of the Eastern Front, an elite unit 
    composed entirely of Eighty-Sixer veterans who have earned names led by their squad leader, 
    Shinei "Undertaker" Nouzen. As Lena gets to know Shinei and the rest of the Spearhead Squadron, 
    she becomes sympathetic to his people's plight and tries to help them. At same time, Lena 
    and Shinei learn a dark secret: the Republic and the war with the Empire is not what it seems.

<h2> Barakamon </h2>
<P>
    Seishuu Handa is an up-and-coming calligrapher: young, handsome, talented, and unfortunately, a narcissist to boot. 
    When a veteran labels his award-winning piece as "unoriginal," Seishuu quickly loses his cool with severe repercussions.
    <br /><br />
    As punishment, and also in order to aid him in self-reflection, Seishuu's father exiles him to the Goto Islands, 
    far from the comfortable Tokyo lifestyle the temperamental artist is used to. Now thrown into a rural setting, 
    Seishuu must attempt to find new inspiration and develop his own unique art style—that is, if boisterous children 
    (headed by the frisky Naru Kotoishi), fujoshi middle schoolers, and energetic old men stop barging into his house! 
    The newest addition to the intimate and quirky Goto community only wants to get some work done, 
    but the islands are far from the peaceful countryside he signed up for. Thanks to his wacky neighbors who are entirely 
    incapable of minding their own business, the arrogant calligrapher learns so much more than he ever hoped to.

<h2> Kamisama Hajimemashita </h2>
<P>
    High schooler Nanami Momozono has quite a few problems of late, beginning with her absentee father being in such extreme debt 
    that they lose everything. Downtrodden and homeless, she runs into a man being harassed by a dog. After helping him, 
    she explains her situation, and to her surprise, he offers her his home in gratitude. But when she discovers that said home is a rundown shrine, 
    she tries to leave; however, she is caught by two shrine spirits and a fox familiar named Tomoe. They mistake her for the man Nanami 
    rescued—the land god of the shrine, Mikage. Realizing that Mikage must have sent her there as a replacement god, Tomoe leaves abruptly, 
    refusing to serve a human.
    <br /><br />
    Rather than going back to being homeless, Nanami immerses herself in her divine duties. But if she must keep things running smoothly, 
    she will need the help of a certain hot-headed fox. In her fumbling attempt to seek out Tomoe, she lands in trouble and 
    ends up sealing a contract with him. Now the two must traverse the path of godhood together as god and familiar; but it will not be easy, 
    for new threats arise in the form of a youkai who wants to devour the girl, a snake that wants to marry her, and Nanami's own unexpected feelings for her new familiar.
